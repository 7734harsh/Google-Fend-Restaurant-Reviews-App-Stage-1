## Introduction:)
For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.


## Run the Application
1. ## Launching app locally
1) Clone the repo
2) Via terminal,Go into the cloned folder
3) If you have python 2.x run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
4) If you have python 3.x run `python -m http.server 8000`
5) With the server running visit `http://localhost:8000`
5) Change the port from dbhelper.js if 8777 is already in use

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
